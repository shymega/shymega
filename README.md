Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===========

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various hobbyist projects.
  I'm also looking for paid work, or an apprenticeship but in the pandemic, this
  is proving tricky!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m .currently learning:
  - Rust.
  - Java.
  - COBOL.
  - Embedded programming.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - [RawrWM][] -a modular and backend-based window manager.
    The aim is to get it to support both X11 and Wayland, and be customised from
    the ground-up.
  - [Xt][] - a modular and fast text editor.
  - [guile-rs][] - GNU Guile bindings to Rust.

      Help is very much needed on this project.

      I would love to work to get interop working with Rust to a basic level,
      and working forward from there.

      I also want to work with other attempts at a
      GNU Guile binding to Rust.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming with Visual Basic 6.0.
