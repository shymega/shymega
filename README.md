Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===========

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various hobbyist projects.
  I'm also looking for paid work, but in the pandemic, this is proving tricky, understandably!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Rust
  - Java
  - Embedded programming
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - [RawrWM][], a modular and backend-based window manager.
    This means it can support both X11 and Wayland, but not at the same time.
  - [Xt][], a modular and fast text editor.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them (but he/him is also OK)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming with Visual Basic 6.0, fun times...
