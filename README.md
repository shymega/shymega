Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===========

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various hobbyist projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Rust
  - Java
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - [RawrWM][] a modular and backend-based window manager.  
    This means it can support both X11 and Wayland.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them (preferred, but he/him is also OK.)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming with Visual Basic 6.0.
